## Datalink
DataLinkHost        10.80.193.27
DataLinkPort        15001

## The following items tell us how to talk to the Q330

IPAddress		10.80.192.222		# The Q330 IP address
BasePort		5330			      # The Q330 base port -
						                #  5330 is the default base port
DataPort		3			          # Which Q330 dataport to use
SerialNumber		0x0100000XXXXXXXXX	# The serial number of the Q330
AuthCode		0x0			        # The Q330 auth code

## one sec and/or miniseed records may be sent
# The default is only one second mode, OneSecMask    1
# Mask values can be added
#OneSecMask    14      # Run in one sec packet mode, 0: none, 1: all
                     # dataserv: 2, 1Hz main: 4, 1Hz environ: 8
#MiniseedMask  30     # Run in miniseed mode, 0: none, 1: all
                     # netserv: 2, configuration: 4, timing: 8
                     # logging: 16

## The following items may help traversing some firewalls

#SourcePortControl	9999	# UDP port to use as a source, when talking to
				# the Q330's control port

#SourcePortData		9998	# UDP port to use as a source when talking to
				# the Q330's data port


## The following items help control the log verbosity

LogLevel	sd, rm, vb, sm, pd 	# Comma seperated list of:
				# sd - Logs Q330 status on connect
				# cr - Logs command retries
				# rm - Pings and sends a user message
				#      to Q330 on connect/disconnect
				# vb - Logs messages for items like
				#      filter delays
				# sm - Logs 800 series messages
				# pd - Logs all packets sent/received

StatusInterval  240		# time in seconds between status updates


## The following items offer some control over connections

FailedRegistrationsBeforeSleep  5	# How many failed connection attempts
					# before we give it a break for a bit
MinutesToSleepBeforeRetry	3	# How long should that break be?


## Some options to control dutycycle
## comment out to disable

#Dutycycle_MaxConnectTime	10	# We'll disconnect after this many
					# minutes of being connected
#Dutycycle_BufferLevel		10	# Disconnect when the Q330's buffer is
					# this percentage filled.
#Dutycycle_SleepTime		30	# Wait this many minutes before
					# connecting again, when we've stopped
					# for either of the above reasons

## Where should we keep our continuity files?
## These will be named: Q3302EW_cont_[dot_d_filename] and have '.bint'
## and '.binq' extensions.
ContinuityFileDirectory	/tmp
